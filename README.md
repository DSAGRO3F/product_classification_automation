# product_classification_automation
Is that possible to automate product classification from text description or image of product ? This project aims at providing answers to that business issue. This business need is put on the table by a large market place that struggles doing this by hand.

Some details...
On the Marketplace, sellers offer items to buyers by posting a photo and a description.
Currently, assigning an item's category is done manually by sellers, and is therefore unreliable. In addition, the volume of items is currently very small.
To make the user experience for sellers (facilitate the posting of new items online) and buyers (facilitate the search for products) as smooth as possible, and with a view to scaling up, it becomes necessary to automate this task.
The mission is to study the feasibility of an engine for classifying articles into different categories, with a sufficient level of precision.
It is specified that there is no intellectual property attached to the texts and images.
